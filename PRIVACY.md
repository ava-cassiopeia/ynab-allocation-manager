# Our Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms
We and our service providers use cookies and other tracking mechanisms to track
information about your use of our Site or Services. We may combine this
information with other personal information we collect from you (and our service
providers may do so on our behalf). We use cookies for functional purposes only
(i.e. to support the proper working of our Site and Services) and do not use
cookies for advertising or profiling purposes.

Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your device’s hard
drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. Some cookies allow
us to make it easier for you to navigate our Site and Services, while others are
used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track your activities
at our Site and Service. There are two types of cookies: session and persistent
cookies.

-   Session Cookies: Session cookies exist only during an online session. They
    disappear from your device when you close your browser or turn off your
    device. We use session cookies to allow our systems to uniquely identify you
    during a session or while you are logged into the Site and Services. This
    allows us to process your online transactions and requests and verify your
    identity, after you have logged in, as you move through our Site and
    Services.

-   Persistent Cookies: Persistent cookies remain on your device after you have
    closed your browser or turned off your device. We use persistent cookies to
    track aggregate and statistical information about user activity.

-   Disabling Cookies: Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if
    you prefer, you can change your browser options to block them in the future.
    The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to
    prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser
    notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies
    altogether. Visitors to our Site and Services who disable cookies will be
    able to browse certain areas of the Site, but some features may not function
    properly.

Third Party: We use automated devices and applications, such as Google
Analytics, to evaluate usage of our Site. We use these tools to help us improve
our Site’s performance and user experiences.

We use Cloudflare’s security services to protect our website, including the use
of strictly necessary cookies to identify malicious traffic and ensure site
security. These cookies do not collect personal data and are required for the
operation of our website.

Do-Not-Track. Currently, our systems do not recognize browser “do-not-track”
requests. You may, however, disable certain tracking as discussed in this
section (e.g., by disabling cookies).

## Third-Party Links

Our Site and Services may contain links to third-party websites. Any access to,
and use of, such linked websites is not governed by this Policy, but instead is
governed by the privacy policies of those third-party websites. We are not
responsible for the information practices of such third-party websites.

## Security of My Personal Information

We have implemented reasonable precautions to protect the information we collect
from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and
destruction. Please be aware that despite our best efforts, no data security
measures can guarantee security.

You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password,
phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared
computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess,
and keeping your log-in and password private. We are not responsible for any
lost, stolen, or compromised passwords or for any activity on your account via
unauthorized password activity.

## Access to My Personal Information

You may modify personal information that you have submitted by logging into your
account and updating your allocations.
